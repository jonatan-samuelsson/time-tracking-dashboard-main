## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

The frontendmentor article on JS eventhandling was really useful, as I learned to use the `data-`-attribute, which made the code a lot cleaner and more efficient. 

I keep getting better at dealing with elements, HTMLCollections etc in JS, but it's still not entirely clear, so need more practice w/ that.

Also, I felt the site needed a tablet layout as well, so I set up a two column layout as an intermediary between mobile and desktop. 

### Continued development

I need to get more confident handling elements in JS. I keep getting confused with the different types returned by functions like `getElementsByClassName` etc

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's CSS custom properties video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LwjfYc1x8) - This really inspired me when styling the different time report cards. It's a super clean and effective way of customizing recurring components without having to use a ton of complex selectors
